# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
 The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a classic two-player game developed in C# using Windows Forms. It provides a simple yet interactive interface where players take turns placing "X" and "O" symbols on a 3x3 grid, competing to form a winning line. This project demonstrates fundamental game logic, user interface design, and score tracking in C#.
